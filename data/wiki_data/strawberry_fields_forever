"Strawberry Fields Forever" was a track from a non-album single that then happened to be used by Capitol Records for the company's expanded ''MMT'' soundtrack release. That means it is NOT a "single from ''Magical Mystery Tour''" – because the song was not released as a single to promote the Capitol LP. Thank you. -->
